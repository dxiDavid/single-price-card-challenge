## Overview

This was an interesting challenge to practise my Flexbox layout skills. The design guide did not have the background color and text color for the paragraph text in the "Why us" section so I used my best judgment. I also tried my best to match the width of my card to the design but at some point it refused to adjust. Not sure what I did wrong.

I'm happy with the way it turned out. It's responsive and looks good on the smallest screen size available in Chrome's DevTools.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

I fisrt started with the mark-up, made sure everything is present then structured it to fit the layout I had in mind. That means putting elements in containers or divs where I needed them (My naming conventions are usually all over the place but I'll come up with a consistent one very soon). Once that was done I laid out everything using flexbox, set max widths, adjusted the font sizes, did some additional styling for the button then proceeded to color what was necessary. After that I set an appropriate breakpoint for the mobile view and ajusted a few things to make it fit.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I didn't really learn anything new in this challenge, just reinforced my knowledge of flexbox and resposive design.

### Continued development

I don't think there anything else I'd like to add.
